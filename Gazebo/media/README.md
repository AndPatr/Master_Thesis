# Before running a new simulation, delete video_frames folder and recreate it by running "delete_and_create_frames_folder.sh"

# To convert the image frames to video --> run "generate_video_from_frames.sh" ---> IMPORTANT: remember to change the destination forlder in the .sh file; otherwise other videos will be overwritten
