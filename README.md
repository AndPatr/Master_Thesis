# "Control and Design of a Two-Wheeled Balancing Mobile Robot with Actuated Legs" (master thesis)

This folder contains some represetative files concerning my Master's thesis.
These include a compressed pdf version of the thesis (some images will not be of the highest quality or can become distorted, due to compression).

All the code, CADs etc... were not included due to space issues.

Should you need the original version of the pdf and/or some of the material, feel free to contact me.
